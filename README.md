# blender-real-sky-dataset

## Introduction

This repository hosts a pipeline for creating realistic sky datasets in Blender using the Real Sky addon. Our primary goal is to generate diverse, high-quality synthetic video sky sequences that can be used in various applications including training data for machine learning models.

The project focuses on creating short sequences (typically 10 frames at 0.33 FPS - mimicking 1 frame every 3 seconds) that capture a wide range of atmospheric conditions, times of day, weather and cloud patterns.
